# Crazy-Midterm-2
This here is a repository of Code used for the purpose of Chris Rogers' Robotics Midterm 2.
Test.py may not be needed as its purpose was to test the hardware code as well as the implementation of libraries. CVCode.py and Main.py are both a work in progress and should implement the readings from CV from the Airtable which is currently not functioning.
